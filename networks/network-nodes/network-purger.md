# Network Purger

![Network Purger](../../.gitbook/assets/tile\_network\_purger.png)

The Network Purger is a simple block with a very simple purpose, purge a single matching item from the Network.

The Purger takes a single item as a 'template' and, once per Slimefun tick, will remove a whole stack of a matching item from the Network - where ever it is found.

The Purger is a Particle Emitter within a Network. If a [Network Crayon](../tools/network-crayon.md) is installed into the Network, it will show when it has successfully purged an item.
