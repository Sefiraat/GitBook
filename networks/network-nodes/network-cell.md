# Network Cell

![Network Cell](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile_network_cell.png)

A Network cell is the most basic form of storage for a Network.

A Cell can store 54 stacks of items (a double-chest's worth) inside itself.

Cells do NOT accept Cargo in or out, nor do they accept items in/out via Network Pushers or Network Grabbers

Cells do not need a Network Monitor attached to expose it's items to the Network.

You also do not need to bridge cells together; Cells, like any other Network Node, extend the network to neighbour cells.
