# Network Controller

![Network Controller](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile_network_controller.png)

The Network Controller is the brain of any Network. A Network cannot function without a controller nor can it have more than one.

So long as a Network block is connected to the Controller via any series of other [Network Nodes](./) it will become a child node of the Controller.

You can use a [Network Probe](../tools/network-probe.md) on a Controller to see exactly what nodes are connected to the Controller, how many of those nodes you have and the total volume of items stored with in the Network as a whole
