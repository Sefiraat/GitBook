# Network Monitor

![Network Monitor](../../.gitbook/assets/tile\_network\_monitor.png)

the Network Monitor exists to 'expose' a connected Inventory to the Network. When right-clicked, it opens up a directional interface allowing you to select which adjacent block it should expose. When selected, the contents of that inventory are then open to the Network, the exposed items will show up in [Grids](network-grid.md) while also allowing Nodes to request/submit items from/to the Inventory where applicable.

Currently the Monitor can access the following blocks:

* Infinity Expansion Storage Units
* [Network Memory Shell](network-memory-shell.md)

The Monitor is a Directional Networks Node and is, therefore, compatible with the [Networks Configurator](../tools/network-configurator.md)

Network Monitors are allowed to be covered using [Block Veils](../../crystamae-historia/tools/block-veil.md) from Crystamae Historia

_A future update will expand monitors to a far larger range of inventories_
