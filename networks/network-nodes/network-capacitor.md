# Network Capacitor

![Capacitor 1](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile_network_capacitor_1.png) ![Capacitor 2](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile_network_capacitor_2.png)

The Network Capacitors are power-storing blocks designed to allow the Network to hold charge.

A Network's total power is the cumulative total of all connected Capacitor's charges

A Capacitor is charged like any other Slimefun Block.

Charge cannot be returned from the Network back into the EnergyNet.

| Capacitor Tier | Stored Energy |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Tier One       | 1,000         |
| Tier Two       | 10,000        |
