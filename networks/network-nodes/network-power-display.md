# Network Power Display

![Network Power Display](../../.gitbook/assets/tile\_network\_power\_display.png)

The Network Power Display will, on Right Click, display the current total power contained within all attached [Network Capacitors](network-capacitor.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Display tries the best it can, but sometimes it will not be totally accurate due to the way EnergyNet and Networks are slightly out of sync - its good for an indication though!
{% endhint %}
