# Network Bridge

![Network Bridge](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile\_network\_bridge.png)

The purpose of the Network Bridge is a very simple one, to bridge gaps in your Network easily and cheaply. This is the cheapest Network block to craft but, at the same time, does nothing other than extend the Network outwards.

Network Bridges are allowed to be covered using [Block Veils](../../crystamae-historia/tools/block-veil.md) from Crystamae Historia
