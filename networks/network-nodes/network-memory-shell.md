# Network Memory Shell

![Network Shell](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile\_network\_shell.png)

The Network Shell is Network's attempt at deep storage (read: Barrel).

They work similarly to Infinity Barrels but the items are not stored directly within the Shell and are, instead, contained within a [Network Memory Card](../tools/network-memory-card.md).

Cards can be swapped at any time with any item registered in the card.

The [Network Memory Card](../tools/network-memory-card.md) is input into the card slot (blue background).

Items can be added manually via the input slot (green background).

Items can be withdrawn from (and a stack will be buffered in) the output slot (orange background).

Network Shells must have a [Network Monitor](network-monitor.md) attached and pointing towards it for the items on the card to be exposed.
