# Network Remote

![Network Remotes](../../.gitbook/assets/networks/tile_network_remote.png)

The Network Remotes allow for wireless access to a [Network Grid](../network-nodes/network-grid.md)

Shift Right Click while holding a remote and targeting a Grid to 'bind' the remote to that Grid.

Right Click while holding a remote to open the bound grid so long as you are in range.

Neither Remotes nor Grids will chunk load themselves which means you need to either have the network in Spawn chunks, loaded chunks or have a chunk loader of some kind.
