# Network Configurator

![Network Configurator](<../../.gitbook/assets/item_network_configurator.png>)

The Network Configurator can store the state of any Directional Network Node and reapply the exact state to others.

Shift + Right Click a Directional Node to copy the settings.

Right Click a Directional Node to paste the settings onto the node.

For directional interfaces that require a template item, like the Pusher, you need to have a copy of that item in your inventory while pasting for the full copy to work. If you do not, the direction will copy and a warning will be raised over the lack of items.

### Directional Node Types

* [Monitor](../network-nodes/network-monitor.md)
* [Grabber](../network-nodes/network-grabber.md)
* [Pusher](../network-nodes/network-pusher.md)
