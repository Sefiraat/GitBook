# Network Crayon

![Network Crayon](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

The Network Crayon is an item that needs to be attached to a [Network Controller](../network-nodes/network-controller.md). when attached, all connected [Network Nodes](../network-nodes/) that are also Particle Emitters will begin to emit particles every Slimefun Tick.

Right Click a [Network Controller](../network-nodes/network-controller.md) while holding a Crayon to add it to the Network. Repeat this to remove it.
