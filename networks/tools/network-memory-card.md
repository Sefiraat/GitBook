# Network Memory Card



![Network Memory Cards](../../.gitbook/assets/tile\_memory\_cards.png)

Network Memory Cards are a deep storage item that can store mass amounts of a single item-type within themselves.

Items are assigned to an empty card by holding the item you wish the card to be assigned to in your off-hand, holding the card in your main-hand and right clicking the air.

You can reassign items at any time, assuming the card is empty.

Cards can be emptied using a Network Wiper.

Cards can be interfaced with by putting the Card inside a Network Shell.

Cards will always void overage, if there is any, this is to stop Network setups getting clogged which, in turn, leads to performance issues.
