# A Better-Barter

Not only do Piglins get more passive as you increase the purification level in the area, you will also get better bartering deals from the as you trade.

Each time an item is dropped when bartering, you have a chance to receive double the items based on the formula below

## Required Purification Level

5 \* (Purification Value / 750) %

| Example Purification Level | Double Chance |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1000                       | 6.66%         |
| 2000                       | 13.33%        |
| 5000                       | 33.33%        |
