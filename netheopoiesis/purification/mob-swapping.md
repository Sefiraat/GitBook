# Mob Swapping

As you purify the Nether, you'll slowly attract new forms of fauna into the world. When a normal Nether mob tried to spawn in a location with a high enough purification level, the spawn will fail and be replaced with one from the Overworld.

These spawns respect the Nether's day/light cycle, meaning you will will get Overworld hostile mobs during the night and passive mobs during the day.

## Required Purification Level
