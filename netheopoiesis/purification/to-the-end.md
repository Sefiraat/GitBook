# To the End!

There is an item in this addon called the Ender Cake. Assuming you have the materials, you can craft this item at any point during your play, but it will only work when placed in a location with a high enough purification value.

When right clicked, this cake will, somehow, teleport you to the End, placing you on an obsidian platform where you appear.

If your main base is in the nether, be sure to [set your respawn point](sleeping-in-the-nether.md)!
