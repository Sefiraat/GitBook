# Purification

The primary mechanic of this addon is the [Purification system](../purification/). When you place/grow certain items from this addon in the nether, they will begin to lift the veil of darkness over the Nether in the surrounding area. This is the ' Purification Value'. Not only will the value increase but the blocks will change. These blocks become progressively more lush as you progress.

As a chunk's purification value increases, you will be rewarded with things that are not normally possible in the Nether:

* [Being able to sleep in a bed!](../purification/sleeping-in-the-nether.md)
* [Being able to place water and grow new crops.](../purification/water-in-the-nether.md)
* [Nether Mob spawns will slowly be replaced with overworld mobs, respecting the Nether's day/light cycle.](../purification/mob-swapping.md)
* [Other Spawns will appear as the purification level gets higher including fish, random passive mobs and even wandering traders!](../purification/mob-spawning.md)
* [Specific mobs will become friendly while in purified ground](../purification/friendly-mobs.md)
* [Bartering reaps greater rewards the higher the purification value](../purification/a-better-barter.md)
* [Travel to the end using the Ender Cake](../purification/to-the-end.md)
* [Passive healing while in a purified region, increasing with the level of purification](../purification/purifying-aura.md)
* In the latter stages, you are able to go beyond just purification being able to:
  * Create overworld biomes in the Nether
  * Convert massive lava lakes into water

And more...

Purification begins by finding a Purification Seed. This seed will kick-start your journey in the nether as, when placed, it will slowly begin to purify the surrounding blocks from Netherrack into Basic Purified Netherrack. Overtime you will learn how to purify the Netherrack further into more rich soil types, each with an increasing effect on the nearby purification value, leading us neatly into our second main mechanic...
