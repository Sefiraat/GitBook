# Stave Configurator

The Stave Configurator is used to mount spell plates on to a magical stave

A Stave is, surprisingly, very easy to craft and source. The downside being is that the Stave does nothing by itself.&#x20;

Just like some sorcerers use runes to imbue a staff with magic, the Stave requires a filled Magical Plate to channel magic.&#x20;

The configurator allows you to add/remove 4 plates to the Stave at any given time. Each plate binds it's spell to a specific player action (Left, Right, Shift-Left and Shift-Right click). Plates can be added and removed freely to customise your load-out whenever.
