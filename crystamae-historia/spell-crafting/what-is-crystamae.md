# What is Crystamae?

### Crystamae

Crystamae is the magical force that flows through the world knitting everything together.

It comes in 9 base forms with each form governing a different abstract aspect of the world's make-up.

| Crystamae Type | Governance                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elemental      | Elemental Crysta governs the most basic raw elemental natures of the world. Drawing forward fire, routing water, forming earth and riding the winds.                                                      |
| Mechanical     | Mechanical Crysta governs the chain reaction between other forms of Crysta. Any moving object, machine or working block will draw on Mechanical Crysta.                                                   |
| Alchemical     | Alchemical Crysta governs the mixing of Crysta variations to form new and exciting Crysta blends.                                                                                                         |
| Historical     | Historical Crysta governs the loss of Crysta over time, rebirthing it into new and different Crysta as part of the never-ending circuit. Historical Crysta will be prevalent in ages or long-lost blocks. |
| Human          | Human Crysta governs the bringing of sentient life and is imbued into near-all items that are made by man and not naturally formed.                                                                       |
| Animal         | Animal Crysta governs new life coming into the world. Every life is kept running by the flow of Animal Crysta through the construct.                                                                      |
| Celestial      | Celestial Crysta governs all other forms of Crysta, leaning the Crysta towards 'light' or 'positive' antipodes.                                                                                           |
| Void           | Void Crysta governs all other forms of Crysta, leaning the Crysta towards 'dark' or 'negative' antipodes.                                                                                                 |
| Philosophical  | Philosophical Crysta does not govern any aspect and is, instead, a by-product of thought diverging from the intended path of natural Crysta and is the only form that is 'man made'.                      |
