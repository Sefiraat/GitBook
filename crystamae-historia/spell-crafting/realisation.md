# Realisation

Having a blocks stories is one thing, but the question is - how to turn them into something less abstract? This is where the Realisation Altar comes in.

A Realisation Altar will take the conceptual stories from a given [storied item](chronicling.md) and force them into the physical world in the form of Crystal growths.

Periodically a Crystal growth will form within a 4 x 4 radius around the altar.

The Crystal on the ground will slowly grow. when fully formed, it will sparkle.

If mined when fully grown it will drop the physical incarnation of Crysta making up the context of the story with the rarity matching the stories rarity.
