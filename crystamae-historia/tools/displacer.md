# Displacer

![Simple and Arcane Displacers](../../.gitbook/assets/item\_displacers.png)

The displacer uses a combination of Animal Crysta in tandem with Alchemical Crysta to reform the bonds between molecules and pass the unbound objects into another dimension, at the same time drawing connected Crysta from another dimension. With each process, a loss is incurred meaning the displacers only have a limited number of uses.

Can be 'upgraded' to a block version called the [Philosophers Spray](../gadgets/philosophers-spray.md) that can be triggered via redstone but loses interaction with entities.
