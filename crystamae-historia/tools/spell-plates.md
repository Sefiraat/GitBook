# Spell Plates

### Basic Spell Plate

The Basic Spell Plate is the first iteration spell plate that allows for the storage of magical spells. Plates can not channel magic just on their own and must be mounted onto a Stave using the [Stave Configurator](../spell-crafting/stave-configurator.md).

Details about how to fill or recharge a Spell plate can be found [here](../spell-crafting/plate-charging.md).
