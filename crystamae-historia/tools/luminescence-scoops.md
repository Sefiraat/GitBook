# Luminescence Scoops

![Luminescence Scoops](../../.gitbook/assets/item\_scoops.png)

The Luminescence Scoops draw power from nearby Celestial Crysta to form an incorporeal floating light source at any desired point. If used on an pre-placed source, it will return that source back into the scoop.

The scoops have a set number of uses but can be refilled by picking up previously placed sources.
