# Recalling Lattice

![Recalling Lattice](../../.gitbook/assets/item\_recall\_lattice.png)

The Recalling Lattice uses the latent Crysta left behind in magical ingots to form a link to live Crysta at a specific point in space. When called upon, the lattice will return the holder back to that point in an instant.

The destination must be a place of known power or a place that has a strong Crysta flow surrounding it. The only known object to work, currently, is the [Diverging Waystone](../gadgets/diverging-waystone.md)
